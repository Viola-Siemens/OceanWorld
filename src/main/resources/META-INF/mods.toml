With COVID-2019, El Ni√±o phenomenon, innumerable earthquake, volcanic eruption and especially sea level rise caused by global warming engulfing minecraft, the world generation has changed a lot.

With this mod, you can hardly find landmasses, but island and endless ocean, and even difficult to contact your friends and meet them.

But luckily, you can find a lot of monuments (not only ocean monuments) in ocean or deep ocean biomes instead, and can even find other illagers who are also raid captains and trigger raids.

Can you still beat the game and survive?
